# CellMap Hackathon 2022

The aim of this hackathon is to enable active developers of established and emerging tools for interactive annotation and machine learning (ML) on large volumetric data to:

* share their experiences and help each other understand their code,
* discuss open problems and evaluate existing solutions,
* help each other improving their tools,
* identify and/ or establish interfaces for interaction between tools and services,
* identify best practices and leaders on various common issues

Specifically, we intend to focus on topics such as image data formats and metadata, versioning of data, backend development, (scalable) ML networks, ML finetuning and transfer learning, training and prediction on large volumes, annotation tools, and active learning.

As these are emerging fields, it is not expected that we will identify the best possible solution for each category, however, honest discussions with the goal to identify the most promising direction are expected. We intend to learn about existing approaches and help each other use or adapt well working solutions.

The hackathon will not have a scheduled agenda other than meals and a break on the weekend. Ad-hoc presentations of some participants are expected as need arises but will not be scheduled ahead of time. We are not planning to present results at the end of the hackathon as it competes with working on actual goals. The organizers will assemble a summarizing report after the hackathon and will collaborate remotely with participants in the process. This report will be published in a freely accessible form (blog or preprint).

It is not necessary to prepare an agenda for the hackathon as we expect it to develop organically. However, we will start communicating before the hackathon begins, and all attendees are more than welcome to start shaping the agenda with pressing issues from their perspective.
